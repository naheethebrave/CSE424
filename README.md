CSE424 - Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition techniques are concerned with the theory and algorithms of putting abstract objects, e.g., measurements made on physical objects, into categories. Typically the categories are assumed to be known in advance, although there are techniques to learn the categories (clustering). Methods of pattern recognition are useful in many applications such as information retrieval, data mining, document image analysis and recognition, computational linguistics, forensics, biometrics, and bioinformatics.

Much of the topics concern statistical classification methods. They include generative methods such as those based on Bayes decision theory and related techniques of parameter estimation and density estimation. Next come discriminative methods such as nearest-neighbor classification, support vector machines. Artificial neural networks, classifier combination and clustering are other major components of pattern recognition.
